Tinder for you dogs!

## Project Description
1. *What it does:*
A very primitive landing page for a match-making service.

2. *Tech used:*
HTML, CSS, and Javascript (Obviously this developer's very first app :D)

3. *Challenges faced and features to implement in the future:*
- New to creating interactive websites and styling with css. Carousal and hover effects were problematic at first, as well as mobile-responsive design, but features now seem to work.
- In future we could add user authentication, real data, and potentially better styling.
- In all honesty, this is not a project to fret over in the future, only to use for learning purposes :)

4. *Run project:*
Clone repo and open the html file on a browser, or use VSCode's "live server" extension.
